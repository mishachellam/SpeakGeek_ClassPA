## Day 2 Assignment

Your assignment this week is to meet with a Front End Engineer (or equivalent) at your company. Like last week, preferably at lunch or during non-peak hours. Before the meeting you should:

* Use the "Inspect Element" tool in Chrome to review your company's HTML. Here are a few things you could look for:
  * In the <head> section, do you recognize any tools (i.e. Google Analytics, Wordpress, Bootstrap, JQuery or Facebook)?
  * In the <body> section, do the id and class names make sense to you?

* Use the "Inspect Element" tool in Chrome to figure out which fonts and font colors your company uses. To find those items:
  * In Chrome, highlight a piece of text then right click on the highlighted area and hit "Inspect Element."
  * In the upper right hand corner of the Elements panel you'll see a box called "Computed Style" -- click on it and look for the CSS properties "color" and "font-family."

* Remove the CSS from your company's website and look at the structure of the data. Remember, to remove the CSS you should:
  * In Chrome, right click on the page and hit "Inspect Element."
  * In the <head> section, look for anything that starts with <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"â€¦>.
  * Select and delete each of those sections.

At the meeting you should:

* Ask about Markdown. Does the company use it? Is there any value in you learning it?
* Ask the engineer how you should submit issues if you ever notice a front-end inconsistency. Don't forget about that whole maker vs manager thing.
* Ask any other HTML/CSS related questions you might have. Specifically, you might want to ask how that engineer learned to markup HTML and CSS.

Before you get to the next class, go to Github and create a Gist that includes:

* Your notes from the Front End Engineer meeting.
* The font and font colors your company uses.
* Any outstanding questions you have about the basics of HTML and CSS.

We will discuss your results and answer any remaining questions at the beginning of class on Wednesday.
